# Stay Ready Lab 01

## Learning Objectives

Since this course requires prior coding experience, and precourse work in java, this should be mostly a review. Students showing a deficiency in any of these topics should be immediately pointed to supplemental material.

### Students at this point should know:
1. [Java Primitives](./docs/javaPrimitives.md)
2. [Strings](./docs/strings.md)
3. [Logical and Relational Operators](./docs/logicalAndRelationalOperators.md)
4. [Conditional Statements](./docs/conditionalStatements.md)
5. [Program Control](./docs/programControl.md)
6. [Object Classes](./docs/objectClasses.md)
7. [Constructor and Method Overloading](./docs/constructorsAndMethodOverloading.md)
8. [Inheritance](./docs/inheritance.md) 


### New Topics:

* Test Driven Development
* UML and Classes
* S in S.O.L.I.D.
* F.I.R.S.T.
* Introduction to Git
